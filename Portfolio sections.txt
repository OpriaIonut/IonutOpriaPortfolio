1. First page needs to have a cool banner

2. Maybe typewriter text, nice font. Work experience, passions, hobbies.

3. Cool aspect to the charts. Possibly animated too. First, programming languages, then softwares used & then special skills in two sections, programming: (network programming, multithreaded programming, backend, shaders, procedural generation, VR development, gameplay) & art: (modelling, sculpting, optimizing & uv unwrapping, texturing, rigging). Special skill section should also have short descriptions for each cell, like in the gamestorm demo.

4. Video preview & tiny description (like in Xion template). When you click them, it expands with more info, and if you click one more time, it open a new page providing all the information + download link. Possibly a button at the end with "more games" which opens up itch.io. Projects: Serenity Garden, Chicken Invaders, Legheitiel Unaelian, Ori Gameplay.

5. Same as the previous one. For stuff in which I cannot provide video, it's going to be a gallery view of images.

6. Hobby management app, JapoTime app, image processing, MVVM apps, etc.

7. Video of me modelling certain things, texturing, UV unrapping, rigging, etc. (short video, 30 sec, edited together). Cells with the 3D models I want to showcase (image). If you expand it's going to become larger and you can rotate it in 3D. Button to make it fullscreen. Models: Zoro, Mecha Girl, Oni Gurl, Enri, God eater Sword, Mech Spider (also publish it on sketchfab + artstation), Sword series anchor, FantasyBow.

8. Farewell note, thank them for their time, maybe add some selling points too, CV download button.


Navbar to forward you to specific sections.
Focus on key features that you build, main contributions, what you learned from each experience.
Special effects that I may want: typewriter, glowing text, mix of gaming fonts, resizing capsules, grid view, 3D panel, special mouse effect, special highlight for cells/buttons, animated graphs, gradients.
Needs to be fully responsive & also work for mobile (this feature can come later)
Need to find cheap hosting service for it.
Expandable special skills.
3D mode should have some post processing, button for wireframe, uv inspection, matcap viewing, fully textured.
